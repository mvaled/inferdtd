"""
An implementation of the 2T-INF algorithm as described in [1]
$Id$

This algorithm takes a set of samples (sequences)
data and produce an automata that generate the
language provided for that samples.

In this implementation samples are any kind of sequence; and the
automata is simply a directed graph.
