"""
A dummy directed graph implementation

This graph is implemented only for the needs of the 2t-inf algorithm
as described in [Bex2006]_.

..  [Bex2006] Geert Jan Bex, Frank Neven, Thomas Schwentick & Karl Tuyls.
    "Inference of concise dtds from xml data."
    In Proceedings Of The 32Nd International Conference On Very Large Data Bases
    Volume 32. 2006.

TODO List
---------

Add a reference counter to edges. The following scenario shows when
this could be useful:

1.  Add an XML sample, then several edges are added to the graph

2.  Add another XML sample, which happens to add an edge that has been
    already created.

3. Remove the first XML sample, the shared edge should prevail.

Currently, the only way to support a removal, is by regenerating the whole
graph from the remaining XML samples.
