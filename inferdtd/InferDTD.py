    Note: This precondition (b) in [Bex2006] is not correct. In an email,
    the author rewrites it to:

    1) r will be made optional if
        ~  * r is not optional, (i.e., the empty string is not in L(r))
        ~  * for each r' in pred(r), succ(r') \cap succ(r) \ne \emptyset

        ~  * pred(r) \ne \emptyset


    NOTE: This implementation consider only the case when `|W|=2`, so some cases
    are not enable . For instance, the GFA obtained by the sequences "abc",
    "bca" and "cab", is not detected, it would require `W` to be `{a, b, c}`.
